## Description
AscenDuo is a co-op / puzzle game where you collaborate to conquer even the tallest of mountains. On your adventures you will encounter several obstacles. Use your pickaxe and your grappling hook to overcome the challenges. Good luck!

## Experience
On top of being lead programmer, I started out with responsibility for the two player characters and the requirements for world prefabs. The project was quite intense as I was the only person continually adding code to the project. By the release, most of the code in the project was written by me (apart from UI which was generated via a Figma plugin). I learned a lot about how to cope with an overwhelming workload and I'm quite proud that I managed to put my head down and just complete the project. There were some conflicts within the team, but we managed to solve the issues together and grew as people because of it. Although the design of the game didn't end up as we intended, we built a strong foundation and knowledge base for teamwork and project management. I find it a bit ironic as the game was about collaboration as well.
