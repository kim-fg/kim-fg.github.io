## Description
Harbingers of New Dawn is a 4-player co-op (LAN) spell-casting shooter game set in a magical world overruled by dark arcane magic. Enter together as agents of an ancient magical task force, charged with a find and retrieve mission for a long lost enchanted artefact.

## Experience
I was responsible for 3C/AI from the start, the player character and the monsters in a nutshell. I collaborated a lot with the other programmers since my responsibilities were quite core to the experience. By the end of the project I had to jump in and fix a lot of the UI functionality to make it both more readable and functional. The project was designed to be multiplayer from day one and it was an absolute delight to work with both the team and the codebase. Some of the code is written using blueprints, but core functionality is written in C++.
